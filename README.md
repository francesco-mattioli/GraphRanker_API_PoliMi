# Computer Science Algorithms and Principles Project A.A. 2020/2021
## Description
The objective of the project is the management of a ranking among weighed direct graphs, the ranking keeps track of the "best" k graphs.
The ranking consists in printing the integer indices of k graphs having k values smaller than the following metric:
* Sum of the shortest paths between node 0 and all other nodes of the graph reachable by 0.
