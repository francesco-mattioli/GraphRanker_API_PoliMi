# Computer Science Algorithms and Principles Project A.A. 2020/2021
## Description:bulb:
The project aims to efficiently implement, both in time and space complexity, a classifier of graphs: a ranking of directed and weighted graphs is to be managed, taking into account the k best graphs.

It is made possible to interface with the program through the STDIN: the commands AddGraph to add a graph to the ranking and TopK to show the k best graphs possible. The number of graphs and k are always specified through the STDIN.

The ranking metric is defined by the sum of all minimum paths between node 0 and all other nodes in the graph reachable from 0
